**Add any game you want!**
Now its possible to add any game to your library. Even those that are not in the database. Just search for a game and click on the "Add to library" button. If the game is not found, you can add it manually just for you. Any items in the site can also be quickly added to your library by right clicking on them.

## New features
- Add any games you want to your library
- Mark a game as a favorite. It will be added to your library and shown in the favorites section
- Pin a game. It will be shown in a special list but won't be added to your library

### Improvements
